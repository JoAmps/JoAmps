- âš¡ Fun fact: I know a thing or two about electrical engineering

### Stuff I've worked on!
<dl>
  <dt>ðŸ”­ Machine Learning and Big Data</dt>
  <dd>I built a wide range of applications using machine learning, from building recommender systems to building models to improve energy efficiency to improving electrical drives systems
   to building models to determine ICU admission likelihood and mortlaity of COVID 19 patients and to building models to extract payment history using LSTM</dd>
  <dt>ðŸŒ± Computer vision.</dt>
  <dd>Its amazing what deep learning can achieve in computer vision. I have worked on computer vision for healthcare purposes, for object detection and locaziation,
  for segmentation and also to recommend images to customers based on wha they clicked/dd>
  <dt>ðŸ‘¯ Descriptive Data Analysis</dt>
  <dd> I have done quite a number of data analysis projects, from identify customer purchasing behaviours to generate insights,
