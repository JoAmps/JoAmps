## Hi there,  I am Hyacinth and welcome to my Github! 


 I'm fascinated by technology, especially  data science machine learning and deep learning and infact, everything data,
and how we can use it to create incredible things that make our lives
easier and better. I really enjoy working with others on exciting projects.
So, while you're navigating this page, if something appeals to you,
don't hesitate to get in touch with me

- ðŸ”­ I am currently working as a freelancer on upwork doing data science work
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m very open to remote data scientist roles
- âš¡ Fun fact: I know a thing or two about electrical engineering

### Stuff I've worked on!
<dl>
  <dt>ðŸ”­ Data Science and Machine Learning </dt>
  <dd>I have built a wide range of applications using machine learning, from building recommender systems to building models to improve energy efficiency to improving electrical drives systems to building models to determine ICU admission likelihood and mortality of COVID 19 patients and to building models to extract payment history using LSTM and so much more</dd>
  <dt>ðŸŒ± Computer vision(deep learning)</dt>
  <dd>Its amazing what deep learning can achieve in computer vision. I have worked on computer vision for healthcare purposes, for object detection and localization,
  for segmentation and also to recommend images to customers based on what they clicked/dd>
  <dt>ðŸ‘¯ Descriptive Data Analysis</dt>
  <dd> I have done quite a number of data analysis projects, from identify customer purchasing behaviours to generate insights,
  determine the customers who would fault a loan and to analyzing factors that contributed to higher salaries among developers</dd>
