## Hi there,  I am Hyacinth and welcome to my Github! 


 I'm fascinated by technology, especially  data science machine learning and deep learning and infact, everything data,
and how we can use it to create incredible things that make our lives
easier and better. I really enjoy working with others on exciting projects.
So, while you're navigating this page, if something appeals to you,
don't hesitate to get in touch with me

- ðŸ”­ I am currently working as a freelancer  doing data science work
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m very open to full time remote data scientist roles
- âš¡ Fun fact: I have a masters in electrical engineering

### Stuff I've worked on!
<dl>
  <dt>ðŸ”­ Data Science and Machine Learning </dt>
  <dd>I have built a wide range of machine learning applications with massive societal impact, from building an explainable deep learning models to help predict COVID-19 patients that should be admitted to the ICU,  to building time series models to forecast shop's revenue for the whole of 2020, to improving an exisiting electrical solar drives systems using AI and machine learning, to building LSTM recommendation system to extract and recommend payment types to users and much much much more.</dd>
  <dt>ðŸŒ± Computer vision(deep learning)</dt>
  <dd>Its amazing what deep learning can achieve in computer vision. I have worked on computer vision applications for a variety of industries, for object detection and localization, for segmentation and also to recommend images to customers based on what they clicked on./dd>
  <dt>ðŸ‘¯ Data Analysis</dt>
  <dd> I have done quite a number of data analysis projects, from identifying customer purchasing behaviours to generate insights,
  determining the customers who would fault a loan, to analyzing factors that contribute to higher salaries among developers</dd>
