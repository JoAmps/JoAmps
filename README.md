## Hi there,  I am Hyacinth and welcome to my Github! 

 I'm fascinated by technology, and all things data, in the fields of data science machine learning and deep learning and infact,
and how we can use it to create incredible things that make our lives
easier and better. I really enjoy working with others on exciting projects.
So, while you're navigating this page, if something appeals to you,
don't hesitate to get in touch with me

- ðŸ”­ I am currently working as a freelancer, working with companies on data projects
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m very open to full time remote data scientist and machine learning engineer roles
- âš¡ Fun fact: I have a masters in electrical engineering

### Stuff I've worked on!
<dl>
  <dt>ðŸ”­ Data Science and Machine Learning </dt>
  <dd>I have built a wide range of machine learning applications with massive societal impact, from building an explainable deep learning models to help predict COVID-19 patients that should be admitted to the ICU,  to building time series models to forecast shop's revenue for the whole of 2020, to improving an exisiting electrical solar drives systems using AI and machine learning, to building LSTM recommendation system to extract and recommend payment types to users and much much much more.</dd>
 
 <dt>ðŸ”­ Data Engineering </dt>
  <dd>I have built relational data models using postgresql, no-sql data models using cassandra, automated data pipelines using apache airflow, built data warehouses and data lakes using amazon redshift and spark respectively. In the field of data engineering, i am just starting out, unlike the data science, but i have excellent skills already. I want to be a full stack data specialist, who can do both the work of a data scientist and data engineer .</dd>
 
  <dt>ðŸŒ± Computer vision(deep learning)</dt>
  <dd>Its amazing what deep learning can achieve in computer vision. I have worked on computer vision applications for a variety of industries, for object detection and localization, for segmentation and also to recommend images to customers based on what they clicked on./dd>
  <dt>ðŸ‘¯ Data Analysis</dt>
  <dd> I have done quite a number of data analysis projects, from identifying customer purchasing behaviours to generate insights,
  determining the customers who would fault a loan, to analyzing factors that contribute to higher salaries among developers</dd>
